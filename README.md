# JAX-AI-Stack ML Project Template

This repository is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template for machine learning projects using the [jax-ai-stack](https://github.com/jax-ai/jax-ai-stack). It provides a structured starting point for developing, training, and deploying ML models with JAX and related tools.

## Features

- Pre-configured project structure for reproducible ML workflows
- Integration with JAX, Flax, Optax, and other libraries from the jax-ai-stack
- Example scripts for training and evaluation
- Utilities for data handling and experiment tracking
- Ready for GPU/TPU acceleration

## Getting Started

Generate a new project using cookiecutter:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/jax-ai/jax-ai-stack-cookiecutter
```

Follow the prompts to customize your project.

## Usage

After generating your project, install dependencies:

```bash
cd your-project-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run example training scripts:

```bash
python examples/train.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- jax-ai-stack (JAX, Flax, Optax, etc.)
- NumPy
- (Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`)
